Studying Tracking

Wish to complete UCB CS61b and Stanford CS106A CS106B
This Reporetory will be used to store the course related information, the documents, the assignments and my notes.
Hope everything goes well.

Here I want to have a daily check-in record here. Everyday I log in and write something below, like what day it is today, what progress I make today and so on.
